# Images-segmentation

Pre-trained detection models such as Mask R-CNN detect and segment objects of fixed classes, including stop signs, in this lab it is proposed to train the selected model to segment 8 types of signs on the Russian road signs dataset https://www.kaggle. com/datasets/viacheslavshalamov/russian-road-signs-segmentation-dataset containing 100,000 images of Russian road signs (the segmentation set is built on the basis of the data set for detection https://graphics.cs.msu.ru/projects/traffic-sign -recognition.html ). Pre-trained models can be used from the MMDetection library https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.
Testing should be carried out on 10 photographs of streets with road signs taken by yourself near ITMO University, if it is impossible for good reasons, then in other recognizable places - these photographs with predicted segmentation will need to be shown to the inspector. The segmentation quality is assessed using the IoU, Precision, Recall, L2 metrics separately on the validation part of the Russian road signs image set and the photographs taken; the percentage of images on which IoU >= 0.5, IoU >= 0.75, IoU >= 0.9 is also of interest.
